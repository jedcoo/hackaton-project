# Hackathon-Project-at-Academia-de-Código

The Hackathon was a 24h project during our 13th week at <Academia de Código_> in teams of 5 elements. 

The project assignment involved the music Skyfall from 007 so my team decided to develop a secret website for a secret agent manager. The idea was to have a normal website where if you click in a hidden spot you get redirected to the login page that will then open your secret agent management page. We created secret agents using info and images of our bootcamp teachers implying that they have an undercover life. 

HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION:

The application starts on this page:  White_Castle/FrontPage/frontpage.html

If you scroll down you will find the secret button that will get you the secret login page: click on "Testimonials"

<img width="780" alt="Secret Button" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116366430/233974450-0811d69e-7cbf-4f84-9a80-74cddf0cc616.png">

Now login with email: whitecastle@wc.com & password: admin

Now you can add your agents and the data will be stored in cookies. 

You can also see our fake ID Generator by clicking on the button on the page right top corner or here: /White_Castle/ID%20Generator/createCC.html
