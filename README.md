# Hackathon-Project-at-Academia-de-CÃ³digo


The project assignment envolved the music Skyfall from 007 so my team decided to develop a secret website for a secrect agent manager. The idea was to have a normal website where if you click in a hidden spot you get redirected to the login page that will then open your secret agent managment page. We created secret agents using info and images of our bootcamp teachers impliing that they have a secret life. 

The application starts on this page:  White_Castle/FrontPage/frontpage.html
If you scroll down you will find the secret button that will allow you to get the secret login page:
